# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Chase; currently a Junior Web Developer Intern at [SetPatrol](https://www.setpatrol.com/) and finishing up my time as a Full-Stack Web Development student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development). My specialties include: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS(Less/Semantic-UI/Material-UI/Styled-Components) & Node/Express. I am passionate about solving problems, designing thoughtful and polished applications and find deep satisfaction in collaborating with teams to build high-quality software that makes a difference in people's lives and the world.

## ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on...
[SetPatrol](https://www.setpatrol.com/), a marketplace where people who need high-end photography and film equipment can find people who are willing to rent it out. There is a huge problem in the film industry and SetPatrol is trying to change all that. The main mission is to solve problems that every filmmaker faces; the cost and availability of professional gear to rent and buy. It is SetPatrol's first priority to be a democratized platform for all storytellers to interact and collaborate. So far I have pair-programmed with the head developer to fix various bugs in the blog portion of the website while learning PHP & Wordpress and gaining experience in navigating an existing codebase. I also recently developed a [double slider](https://codepen.io/ChaseOfTheCollins/pen/xxVGwae) that takes in a gear value and days you want to rent it and outputs an amount of money you could earn using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

I'm also constantly tweaking my [portfolio website](https://chasecollins.tech), a single page React app that I built from scratch and styled using [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/).

## âš¡ Some trivia about me...
I've been a head coffee roaster for 3+ years at two high-end specialty coffee roasters in Northern Colorado. This has honed my skills in organization, problem-solving (coffee is seasonal and varies from farm to farm, so never a constant variable), communication & self-motivation. I've maintained and excelled at this full-time job while learning web development in the evenings and weekends at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/), a fully remote 18 month bootcamp that teaches Full-Stack Web Development & Computer Science through hands on curriculum and fosters a Agile software development environment throughout the entire course. 

I'm an avid rock climber and corgi dad. 

I'm a voracious reader who always has a stack of books I'm reading (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Literature, Philosophy, Science & History). 

When I'm not able to read I'm usually listening to podcasts (Tech, Science, Philosophy & Film).
