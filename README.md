# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about creating solutions, iterating on well-designed applications with impeccable UI/UX and and find deep satisfaction in collaborating with teams to build software that makes a difference in people's lives and the world.

[ReVitalize](https://staging.d1y2qgealrmo9w.amplifyapp.com/), a modern approach to building your community through crowdfunding to create apprenticeship opportunities that help tradesmen develop skills to gain licensing.

## âš¡ Some trivia about me...
I've been a head coffee roaster for 3+ years at two high-end specialty coffee roasters in Northern Colorado. This has honed my skills in organization, problem-solving (coffee is seasonal and varies from farm to farm, so never a constant variable), communication & self-motivation. I've maintained and excelled at this full-time job while learning web development in the evenings and weekends at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/), a fully remote 18 month bootcamp that teaches Full-Stack Web Development & Computer Science through hands on curriculum and fosters a Agile software development environment throughout the entire course. 

I'm an avid rock climber and corgi dad. 

I'm a voracious reader who always has a stack of books I'm reading (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Literature, Philosophy, Science & History). 

When I'm not able to read I'm usually listening to podcasts (Tech, Science, Philosophy & Film).
